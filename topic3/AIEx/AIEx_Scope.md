# Topic 3  Predictive maintenance forecasts equipment failures using machine learning, sensor data analysis, and anomaly detection.Â 
# Define Objectives
- Goals:
- Forecast equipment failures before they occur.
- Minimize downtime and maintenance costs.
- Improve equipment lifespan and operational efficiency.

# Select Tools and Frameworks
- 1. Machine Learning Frameworks:
- TensorFlow, PyTorch for deep learning.
- Scikit-learn for traditional ML models. 
- 
- 2. Time-Series Libraries:
- GluonTS, Facebook Prophet.
- Statsmodels, tsfresh (feature extraction).

- 3. Anomaly Detection Tools:
- Isolation Forest, Autoencoders.
- One-Class SVM.

- 4. Deployment Tools:
- Flask/FastAPI for APIs.
- Streamlit/Dash for dashboards.

# Build Models
- 1 .Supervised Learning (if failure labels are available):

- Algorithms: Random Forest, Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM), Deep Neural Networks.
- Labels: Binary (failure/no failure), Multi-class (type of failure).

- 2. Unsupervised Learning (for anomaly detection):
- Models: Isolation Forest, K-Means, Autoencoders.
- Anomaly score thresholding for failure prediction.

- 3. Remaining Useful Life (RUL) Prediction:
- Time-series models: LSTMs, GRUs, Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs).
- Regression-based approaches for RUL estimation.
