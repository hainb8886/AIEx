# Topic 4	Fraud detection in financial transactions using supervised learning algorithms, anomaly detection, and real-time data processing. 				

# 1. Application Overview
- Key Features:

- Detect fraudulent transactions in banking or cryptocurrency systems.
- Use a hybrid approach:
- Supervised Learning: Classify transactions using historical labeled data.
- Anomaly Detection: Identify rare or new patterns.
- Process transactions in real-time with tools like Apache Kafka or RabbitMQ.
- Provide actionable alerts with risk scores to block suspicious activities.

# 2. Architecture
- The architecture for fraud detection includes these components:
# Data Ingestion:
- Stream transaction data in real-time using Kafka, RabbitMQ, or Pub/Sub.
- Data Preprocessing:
- Feature engineering: Extract behavioral patterns (velocity, volume, location).
- Encode transaction attributes. 
# Fraud Detection Models:
- Supervised Learning: Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression.
- Anomaly Detection: Isolation Forest, Autoencoders, One-Class SVM.
- Real-Time Model Inference:
- Serve models using FastAPI or Flask.
# Alert System:
- Risk scoring for alert prioritization.
- Alerts via email, Slack, or logging systems.
# Dashboard & Monitoring:
- Display metrics (fraud rate, model accuracy) in tools like Grafana or Streamlit.
