# Topic 5	Personalized product recommendations using collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and reinforcement learning. 		

# I. Approaches:
- User-based collaborative filtering:
- Finds similar users based on past preferences and recommends items that similar users liked.
- Item-based collaborative filtering:
- Finds items that are often liked together and recommends them to the user.

# II. Techniques:
- Matrix factorization (e.g., SVD):
- Decomposes the user-item interaction matrix to find latent factors.
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):
- Uses distance measures to find similar users/items.

# Build an application
# 1. Application Overview
- Features:
- Collaborative Filtering:
- Recommend movies based on user similarity (e.g., people who like similar movies).
- Example: "Users who liked Inception also liked Interstellar."

- Content-Based Filtering:
- Recommend movies based on attributes (e.g., genre, director, cast, keywords).
- Example: "If you liked a Sci-Fi movie directed by Christopher Nolan, here’s another one."

- Reinforcement Learning:
- Dynamically adapt recommendations by learning from user actions (clicks, watch completions, ratings).
- Example: Highlight trending or popular movies.

# 2. Architecture
- High-Level Flow:
- Data Collection:
- Movie metadata (genres, actors, directors, ratings, etc.).
- User interaction data (ratings, watch history, clicks).
- Model Training:
- Collaborative Filtering: Matrix Factorization, Neural Collaborative Filtering.
- Content-Based Filtering: TF-IDF, embeddings, or similarity measures.
- Reinforcement Learning: Contextual Bandits, Deep Q-Learning.
- Recommendation Engine:
- Combine predictions from collaborative and content-based filtering.
- Fine-tune using reinforcement learning.
- User Interface:
- Provide real-time movie recommendations on a web or mobile app.
- Feedback Loop:
- Continuously update models based on user feedback.
