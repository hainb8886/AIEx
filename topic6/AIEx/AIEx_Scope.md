# 4. Integration
- The integration of these technologies enables the autonomous vehicle to operate cohesively:
- Workflow:
- Perception:
- Gather raw data from cameras, LiDAR, and radar.
- Process the data using computer vision and sensor fusion.
# Decision Making:
- Use reinforcement learning models to decide actions (e.g., acceleration, braking, or steering).
# Control:
- Execute decisions using vehicle actuators (e.g., throttle, brakes, and steering).
# Example Workflow:
- Detect an obstacle using YOLO (Computer Vision).
- Fuse distance data from LiDAR and radar (Sensor Fusion).
- Navigate around the obstacle using a PPO-trained RL agent (Reinforcement Learning).
