- TOPIC 2: AI systems analyse medical images to detect diseases using CNNs, deep learning, and transfer learning.Â 
# I. Define Goals and Requirements
# 1. Disease Detection:
- Specify target diseases (e.g., cancer, pneumonia, fractures).
- Identify imaging modalities (e.g., X-rays, MRIs, CT scans, ultrasound).

# 2. Dataset:
- Collect a large, labeled dataset of medical images.
- Sources: Public datasets (e.g., NIH Chest X-rays, ISIC for skin lesions, Kaggle medical datasets).
- Ensure data is annotated by medical experts.

# 3. Regulatory Compliance:
- Adhere to medical data privacy laws (e.g., HIPAA, GDPR).
- Obtain ethical clearance for data use if required.

# II: Choose Tools and Frameworks
# 1. Deep Learning Frameworks:
- TensorFlow/Keras
- PyTorch

# 2. Transfer Learning Models:
- Pre-trained CNNs: ResNet, Inception, VGG, EfficientNet.
- Specialized medical models (e.g., CheXNet for chest X-rays).

# 3. Image Processing Libraries:
- OpenCV
- PIL (Pillow)
- scikit-image

# 4. Cloud/Hardware:
- GPUs: NVIDIA CUDA for training.
- Cloud: Google Cloud, AWS, or Azure for large-scale training.


# III. Select Tools and Frameworks
# 1. Machine Learning Frameworks:
- TensorFlow, PyTorch for deep learning.
- Scikit-learn for traditional ML models.

# 2. Time-Series Libraries:
- GluonTS, Facebook Prophet.
- Statsmodels, tsfresh (feature extraction).

# 3. Anomaly Detection Tools:
- Isolation Forest, Autoencoders.
- One-Class SVM.

# 4. Deployment Tools:
- Flask/FastAPI for APIs.
- Streamlit/Dash for dashboards.
